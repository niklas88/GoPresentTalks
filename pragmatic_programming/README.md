# The Go Programming Language

## Pragmatic Programming

I held this talk at the University of Freiburg on 1st of August 2017.

some of you may already have heard about the Go programming language which has
seen a rise in popularity[0](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/)  in the wider
community as well as within our Algorithms and Data Structures group. As I had
already used Go in some projects, actively follow its development since before
its 1.0 version and contributed a simple change to its standard library
I volunteered to give an informal introductory talk.

As there are plenty of resources to get you started on using Go (eg
[1](https://golang.org/doc/ )) I will not attempt to teach you the basics of
Go. Instead, I will try to show the challenges Go tries to solve and what ideas
its designers came up with. Ideally this should help you to judge whether Go's
design goals are a good fit for your projects. As such I will assume some
familarity with at least one other programming language.
